abstract: Kirchhoff’s circuit laws are important basic concepts in many basic
  disciplines, such as electricity and circuitry. However, in the usual teaching
  process, teachers often teach this knowledge using some simple examples of
  analysis and calculation but without deep discussions. As a result, students
  could not have a deep understanding about these concepts or not apply the
  concepts on actual problems flexibly. Therefore, passive learning habits are
  formed. The lack of self-exploration awareness and comprehensive ability would
  result in a poor learning effect. This paper designs a specific application
  scene of Kirchhoff’s circuit laws using a multi-channel resistor network. With
  this application, students can construct the knowledge system autonomously,
  find the problems proactively, solve the problems timely, and combine the
  research-based autonomous learning with extracurricular open mutual learning;
  so, their active learning ability will be promoted to a large extent. Compared
  with the past teaching methods, this pedagogical case highlights the following
  advantages of active learning. Firstly, it highlights the process of guiding
  students to study the object from a small-scale resistor network to a complex
  and large-scale multi-channel resistor network. Secondly, it embodies the
  concrete application of calculus knowledge in various basic courses with the
  help of perfect mathematical deduction. Thirdly, it exercises students’
  programming ability by using MATLAB to numerically simulate theoretical
  results. Finally, this case practices students’ hands-on experimental ability
  by constructing real resistor circuits and verifying the theory and simulation
  results. In addition, we get good feedback from students on the teaching
  effect through the questionnaire survey.
