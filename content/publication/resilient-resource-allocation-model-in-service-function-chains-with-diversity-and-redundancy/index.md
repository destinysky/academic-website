abstract: This paper proposes an optimization model to derive the resilient
  virtual network function allocation in service function chains aiming to
  reduce the recovery time during the migrations from the primary functions to
  backup functions. We consider k-fault-tolerance assurance and satisfy the
  service requirements under different error patterns in this model. The
  allocation provided by the proposed model ensures that the processing ability
  satisfies the requirements even though there are k failed nodes in the
  network. Diversity splits a single VNF into a pool of replicas with different
  specifications. The diversity of both primary and backup functions are
  considered. Redundancy is used for recovering the failed functions. We
  formulate the proposed model as a mixed integer linear programming problem to
  select suitable replicas from the pools of replicas and decide the locations
  of these replicas for both primary and backup functions. The objective of the
  proposed model is to minimize the sum of the maximum recovery time among
  functions under all possible failure patterns which have k node failures. The
  numerical results show that the proposed model reduces the recovery times of
  VNFs with ensuring the resiliency of the functions compared with baseline
  models in the examined cases. We give some methods to improve the maximum
  resiliency at last.
