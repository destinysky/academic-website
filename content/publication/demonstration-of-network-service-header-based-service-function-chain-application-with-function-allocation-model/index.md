abstract: A virtual network function allocation model to maximize continuous
  available time was introduced in our previous work. The performance of this
  model needs to be evaluated on network devices. It is time-consuming and
  costly to deploy functions with real network devices. Existing simulation
  tools require powerful computation capability, which limits the usable cases.
  We implement a network service header based service function chain application
  which can be cooperated with the model. Demonstration validates that the
  application allocates functions by using the allocation from the model
  automatically and runs service function chains correctly.
