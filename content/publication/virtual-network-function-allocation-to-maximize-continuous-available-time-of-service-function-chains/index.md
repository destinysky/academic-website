abstract: This paper proposes an optimization model to derive a virtual network
  function (VNF) allocation for time slots in sequence aiming to maximize the
  continuous available time of service function chains (SFCs) in a network. The
  proposed model suppresses service interruptions due to the unavailability of
  nodes and the reallocation of VNFs. Compared with conventional models, the
  proposed model computes the VNF allocation in a series of time slots based on
  the network node availability schedule, which provides information on whether
  each network node is available at each time slot. We formulate the proposed
  model as an integer linear programming problem with the goal of maximizing the
  minimum number of longest continuous available time slots in each SFC. The
  numerical results show that the proposed model improves the continuous
  available time of SFCs compared with existing models.
