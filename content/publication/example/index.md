abstract: This paper proposes an optimization model to derive the virtual
  network function (VNF) allocation of time slots in sequence aiming to maximize
  the continuous available time of service function chains (SFCs) in a network.
  The proposed model suppresses service interruptions otherwise created by the
  unavailability of virtual machines (VMs) and the reallocation of VNFs. The
  proposed model computes VNF allocation in a series of time slots based on a VM
  availability schedule, which provides information on the availability of each
  VM in each time slot. We formulate the proposed model as an integer linear
  programming (ILP) problem with the goal of maximizing the minimum number of
  longest continuous available time slots in each SFC. We prove that the
  decision version of the VNF allocation problem (VNFA) is NP-complete. As the
  size of ILP problem increases, the problem is difficult to solve in a
  practical time. We develop a heuristic algorithm to solve the VNFA problem.
  Numerical results show that the proposed model improves the continuous
  available time of SFCs compared with existing models, which partially consider
  VM unavailability or VNF reallocation. We observe that the proposed model
  together with a consideration of routing reduces the path length of requests.
  The developed heuristic algorithm is faster than the ILP approach with a
  limited performance penalty.
