abstract: Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides a promising solution in
  flexible management of sensor networks by allowing the separation of the
  control logic from the sensor/actuator nodes. The classical-network-based
  sensor networks are often difficult to improve the network performance. To
  solve this problem, this paper designs a protocol based on OpenFlow and a
  structure of which core idea is inspired by the computer architecture. With
  the help of this protocol, we can collect the data from sensors and actuators,
  control and manage them and improve the performance of network.
